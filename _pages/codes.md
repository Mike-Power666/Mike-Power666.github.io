<p>This page is a work in progress. I'm currently (very slowly) changing a lot of my old code, mostly written in Fortran77, to modern Fortran and to be modular. Coming soon (after I convert and modularize them)... My version of the Worm Hole Generation project from Kip Thorne for Interstellar, a Stellar Wind Bow Shock and Polarization Calculator for Zeus3D, my Riemann Problem Solver, my first MHD (magnetohydrodynamics) solver, my first SPH (smooth particle hydrodynamics) solver, and some other stuff too!</p>

<h3>Available Code Repositories</h3>

    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/Mike-Power666/Cross-Correlation_Calculator" target="_blank">Cross-Correlation Calculator</a>
        <p>A very inefficient cross-correlation calculator with not-so-good code structure!<br><br>
        I'm more or less uploading this for the individual pieces of the code instead of the whole. It works very well; it was made rapidly to brute force a problem!<br><br>
        The cross-correlation calculator is probably not useful, but I think the integrator and some other individual modules may be useful.</p>
