# Wisdom & Whimsy

This is a place for me to share open source documents (or comedy) which I have found particularly illuminating (I've only put two here to finally get the website up). Most documents will have been created by others, but some (when I get around to it) will be from yours truly.

### MHD Primer
- [MHD Primer (PDF)](/assets/Files/MHD_Primer.pdf)  
  *Description:* This primer provides an introduction to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), covering the basic principles, and equations. It was written by my undergraduate supervisor, David Clarke, and it provides an incredible hook to get into the field.

### Tensor Calculus Primer
- [Tensor Calculus Primer (PDF)](/assets/Files/Tensor_Calculus_Primer.pdf)  
  *Description:* This primer introduces the fundamental concepts of tensor calculus, explaining key ideas, notations, and operations. It was written by my undergraduate supervisor, David Clarke. In my humble opinion, this serves as one of the greatest refreshers on tensor calculus I've ever found. I plan to make edits to this document to include General and Numerical Relativity, but probably not anytime too soon!
