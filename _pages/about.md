Hi! I'm Mike, a soon-to-be PhD student working under Dr Chris Matzner at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) at the University of Toronto. 

My Work and Research Interests
------
I'm interested in theoretical astrophysics, and I am particularly interested in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and plasmas. I like to walk the line and bridge the gap between pure theoretical and computational work. During my undergraduate studies with Dr. David Clarke, I developed a theoretical model for multifluid ambipolar diffusion with realistic ionization and associated energy and momentum transfer. Before that, I dabbled in some statistical mechanics with Dr Geoffrey Lee-Dadswell and developed a mathematical model of "chain-breaking" for "ding-a-ling" chains in a Lennard-Jones potential. Most recently, working with Dr. Hilding Neilson for my MSc, I developed a new host of algorithms for the astrophysical MHD code ZEUS-3D. These algorithms allow Zeus to simulate bow shocks formed during the interaction between a stellar wind and a local interstellar medium (ISM). These routines include the ability for Zeus to calculate the observed polarization signal, assuming the case of optically thin Thomson scattering. 

During my PhD, I plan to develop algorithms and theory using non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics and plasma physics to solve some unanswered questions in star formation.

Background and History
------
I was born and raised in New Waterford, on Cape Breton Island. As a Cape Bretoner, I have a strong love for our local culture, music, and heritage (you can learn more in general [here](https://www.cbisland.com/things-to-do/culture-heritage/), but if you're really interested, you can grab a copy of the Cape Breton Dictionary [here](https://utorontopress.com/9781442615991/dictionary-of-cape-breton-english/)). In particular, I have a strong stance on unions and workers' rights due to the history of my home town (the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Waterford,_Nova_Scotia) is a great place to start; however, it doesn't do the full story justice) and what generations of families here have suffered through. 

My mother, Kathy, was a stay-at-home mom for most of my life. After I graduated high school, she went back to work and became a teaching assistant in the local school system, working directly with students who have severe behavioural issues or special needs; she's often given the most 'difficult' cases, though she wouldn't refer to them like that, as others tend to! She has a background in child psychology and social work and is well-known in the local schools for her uncanny ability to educate students where all others fail. My father, Gerard, is a tradesman (now retired). He helped to build the Lingan generating station. Eventually, he worked there for most of his life for Nova Scotia Power, which eventually became a subsidiary of the Emera Corporation. I owe very much to my father, as he was adamant about breaking the cycle. From a very young age, he insisted that I use my brain and not my body to make a living. I have one sibling, my sister Mary (now Mary Fecho), who has two children; my nephew Ollie and my niece Nora.

I started my education at Greenfield Elementary in New Waterford (fun fact: I was part of the first class to go through primary grades to grade six after the school first opened). After Greenfield, I moved to Breton Education Centre in New Waterford from grades 7-12. I was always extremely bored in school and didn't care much for it. I flew 'under the radar' of most teachers because I didn't cause problems and always finished my work so I could hang out with my friends. It was in my grade 11 year when things started to change. There, I met my mathematics teacher, Colin Campbell, my physics teacher, Erin Morrorw, and a physics practice teacher, Mr. McGinnis (I don't know his first name; we only called him by his last). For the first time in my education, these three teachers took an interest in me and challenged me to improve. This started a cascade of interest that ended up with Erin Morrow linking me to MIT OpenCourseWare physics with Walter Lewin, which I began to eat up. As silly as this sounds, I can recall googling "how to become a physicist" before leaving high school, but I ended up in Engineering at Cape Breton University (CBU) on the advice that I was "good at math and physics", so "[I] should become an engineer". At CBU, I was taught physics by Dr. Chris Cameron and Dr. Geoffrey Lee-Dadswell, and mathematics by Dr. Scott Rodney. In my second year at CBU, I fell so in love with physics and mathematics that I received permission from the Dean of Science to take seven courses simultaneously. Five of these courses were within the regular engineering program. Still, the other two were upper-year mathematics courses for which I didn't have the prerequisites. They were a tensor calculus course focused on fluid mechanics and a partial differential equations course I took concurrently with ordinary differential equations. After my second year, I moved on to Dalhousie University (DAL) engineering, where, after a few months, I couldn't deny my want for physics any longer. I dropped out of engineering and joined the physics department at Saint Mary's University (SMU).

I met several amazing teachers and physicists at SMU, but the person who influenced me most was [Dr. David Clarke](http://www.ap.smu.ca/~dclarke/home/). I respect no one on Earth more than David and compare my teaching and learning experiences to his. He is one of the best educators I have ever known and probably the most difficult! Any course taken from David gave an 'Ivy League education at a minimum! I enjoyed David's courses so much that I did my honours research with him. After undergrad, I spent some time at TRIUMF (Canada's National Particle Accelerator). Then, I returned to CBU, where I received my Bachelor of Education degree to pursue my passion for teaching and education. During the tail end of the pandemic, I taught high school at [Cabot High](https://sites.google.com/gnspes.ca/caboteducationcentre/home) in the Cape Breton Highlands, eventually leaving to return to my own graduate studies. I moved to St. John's, Newfoundland, to work with Dr. Hilding Neilson at Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) for my MSc in physics. 

Hobbies and Interests
------
Looking at me, one would not expect it, but I was once an extremely talented kickboxer and practitioner of Uechi-Ryu Karate (in which I hold a second-degree black belt). I've dabbled in Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu and Judo, and if I could live two separate lives, one would be my current academic life. Still, the other would certainly have been a career in combat sports (I was very close to choosing the latter). I had the great honour and privilege of being a student of Daniel MacDougall and Gilbert MacIntyre, both are eighth and seventh-degree black belts, respectively the former of which was inducted into the Cape Breton Hall of Fame as a builder for his contribution to combat sports in Cape Breton. 

In my culture, music is very important. I play the piano, saxophone, guitar, and a few percussion instruments, which one would find in a concert band (bells, timpani, xylophone, etc.). On the piano, I mostly play traditional Cape Breton music, which I was taught by Mario Colosimo and the late, great [Doug McPhee](https://www.cbu.ca/alumni/honorary-degree-recipients/mr-douglas-t-macphee/). However, my typical listening involves mostly metal from Iron Maiden, Metallica, and Avenged Sevenfold. 

Other than that, I'm a gamer, a movie buff, and a lover of fantasy books and shows (Game of Thrones, The Wheel of Time, The Lord of the Rings, etc.). I'm also always trying to push my knowledge of computer science further.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
